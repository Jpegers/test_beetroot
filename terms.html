            </p>
            <p>
                6.1 Risk of loss in value as digital assets are not issued by any central banks or national, supra-national, or quasi-national organizations. They are also not backed by any hard assets or other credit. The value of digital assets is affected by several factors, including but not limited to:
            </p>
            <p>
                (a) the total number of digital assets in existence;
            </p>
            <p>
                (b) the continued willingness of market participants to exchange government-issued currency for digital assets;

                (c) purchasers’ expectations with respect to the rate of inflation of fiat currencies;

            <p>
                (i) regulatory measures; or
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>

            </p>

                6.3 The Website and the Platform may experience system failures, unplanned interruptions in their network or services, hardware or software defects, security breaches or other causes that could adversely affect the Website’s or the Platform’s infrastructure network. the Website is unable to anticipate when there would be the occurrence of hacks, cyber-attacks, mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks and selfish-mining attacks, re-entrancy attacks, distributed denials of service or errors, vulnerabilities or defects in any component of the Website or the Platform or any related technology or software, including but not limited to smart contract technology and/or any software compilers used. the Website is unable to detect these hacks as mentioned earlier, mining attacks, cyber-attacks, re-entrancy attacks, distributed denials of services errors vulnerabilities or defects in a timely manner and does not have sufficient resources to efficiently cope with multiple services incidents happening simultaneously or in rapid succession.

            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
